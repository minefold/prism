* Move to [Ragel](http://www.complang.org/ragel) for packet parsing.
    It's one of the fastest parser generators around and will generate
    stand-alone code for a variety of targets (mainly C & Ruby). Works on a
    byte level so converting UTF-16 characters will be faster too.

* Go through all the code from the point of view of somebody who isn't signed
    up for the service and also from a potential attacker.
